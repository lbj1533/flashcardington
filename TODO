Problems with the study interface:
-words should not move when a note is introduced. 
-decrease blank space in the app, make buttons bigger and overall improve the interface.
-enter shortcut only works for the first flashcard, and does not work thereafter.
-question should simply show the question, not "Question: [question]".
-after the user gets the question wrong, show the correct answer where you would normally show only the error message. it should be formatted like this. "Incorrect. Correct Answer: [correct answer]"
-Once the session has completed, show a repeat set button, and a quit button, additionally the quit button should be present the whole time while studying so the user can quit studying whenever they want.

Problems with the set creation interface:
- the box for the creation of the notes should be smaller, and the boxes for the questions and answers should be bigger.
- allow tabbing over the note text box, only if the last input was tabbing or shift tabbing from another text box or dropdown.
- entering to add the created card does not work
- create a place to name the set to be created.
- saving an empty set appears to work in the gui, but doesnt actually do anything behind the scenes, make sure the gui shows that it doesnt work.
- saving the set right now saves the created set to the parent directory of the one selected.
- once a set is created, go back to the welcome screen
- create a quit button so the user can leave the set creation interface without creating a set.

Problems with the study interface:
- the load flashcards button should initialize to the flashcards directory
- pressing return to submit the flashcard still does not work past the first one
- an additional quit button does not need to be created when the set has completed, as there is one that is always there.
- the repeat set button crashes, simply remove it for now

Problems with the creation interface
- enter still does not work to save a flashcard
- ctrl-s does not save the set either.

Problems with the study interface:
- return to submit only works on the first card, allow it to work on every card, interestingly, it still says Question: [question] and note: [note] instead of just having [question] and [note] on the first flashcard, perhaps these are linked. Another theory could be that when I press return and i am focused into the answer box, it simply attempts to enter a newline character instead of submitting the card. Either way, fix this.
- a note shifts the interface around, prevent this. The interface should look the same whether or not the note is present, just with or without the note.

Problems with the flashcard set creation interface:
- allow tab to skip over the note field, so it goes straight to add card
